    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>40g piece of ginger</li>
        <li>6 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 lemon, jucied</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>cooked rice and steamed broccoli, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the chicken into a bowl, sprinkle over the flour and some seasoning and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Combine the ginger, garlic, soy, honey and half the lemon juice in a bowl. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat and fry the chicken for 3-4 mins until lightly golden. Tip in the honey sauce and stir-fry for 10 mins, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste for seasoning and squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, if needed, then serve with rice and steamed broccoli, if you like.</li>
